# keegan.codes

https://keegan.codes

This is my personal website. It was originally built on an early beta of Next.js 14, so not everything may be an ideal example of how it should be built today.

It's built using the Next.js app directory:
- Server components
- Parallel & Intercepted routes
- OG image generation
- Edge configs
- Edge runtime
