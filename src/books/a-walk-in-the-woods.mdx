As an avid hiker and self-proclaimed outdoorsman, I was really looking forward to reading this book after it was given to me as a gift by my brother. I enjoyed hearing the humorous but sometimes dangerous stories from the trail, and the people Bryson and his hiking partner encountered.

This book likely won't make you want to hike the trail yourself if the thought has never crossed your mind, but as someone who's had it as a goal for a long time, it certainly renewed my interest and got me excited again! Following along as Bill learns about the gear needed to hike the trail, as well as the skills and physical fitness necessary reminded me of my days in scouting learning to navigate the outdoors for myself.

This was a good read and I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in the outdoors and adventure, but with a few hours to kill indoors!
