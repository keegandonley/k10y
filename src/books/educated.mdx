This book was recommended to me by many people so my girlfriend and I decided to read it together. In it, Tara Westover describes her life of isolation as the child of survivalists. We follow her life as she sets foot in a classroom for the first time at the age of 17, and continues to strive for knowledge as she grows up.

The book challenges the idea of family and explores the idea of growing into your own person, and what it means when that person goes against everything your parents believe. It was a thought-provoking read and I thoroughly enjoyed it
