_Nobber_ is written by a young Irish writer named Oisín Fagan. I purchased my copy when visiting Galway, Ireland at [Charlie Byrne's Bookshop](https://charliebyrne.ie/ "Charlie Byrne's Bookshop"). I hadn't read fiction in quite some time, so I was looking forward to getting starting with this work of historical fiction.

It was a really fun read, despite being a violent and visceral story about life in the Irish countryside during the plague in Ireland during the 14th century. The story follows a nobleman who takes advantage of the chaos and despair of the times to acquire large swaths of land.

Much of the story takes place in a town called Nobber, and it was fun to read the story and hear town names mentioned that I had recently visited in Ireland for myself.

A lot of horrifying and terrible things happen to nearly every character encountered, but somehow the story manages to maintain a bit of humor throughout and I thoroughly enjoyed every page.
