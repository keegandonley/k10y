As the year winds down, I want to first take a moment to thank you for reading my posts over the last year!

This was an exciting year for me, as I started
my first role as a principal engineer and learned a ton. I redesigned my website, and started working to build a community around my blog. I also met so
many great people at conferences and meetups around the country and North America, from [Render Atlanta](https://www.renderatl.com/)
to [Tailwind Connect](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/2023-07-18-tailwind-connect-2023-recap)!

> Tailwind Connect in Cambridge, Ontario was probably my favorite event of the year!

I stopped writing my newsletter after Twitter killed off Revue, but I'm hoping to start it back up again in 2024. I also started a [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/keegancodes/)
for discussion of my blog posts. If that's your scene, [join me over there](https://www.reddit.com/r/keegancodes/)!

## From My Blog

It was a busy year! Here's a quick walk back through all the posts I wrote:

I started off the year writing about [my pull request process](https://keegan.codes/blog/review-your-own-pull-requests) and some approaches I take to writing quality code:

<PostPreview slug="review-your-own-pull-requests" />

In keeping with what is seemingly an annual tradition, I also wrote about [connected fitness and how I use Apple Shortcuts](https://keegan.codes/blog/filling-in-the-connected-fitness-gaps-with-apple-shortcuts) to fill in some gaps in the automations I've come to rely on:

<PostPreview slug="filling-in-the-connected-fitness-gaps-with-apple-shortcuts" />

In May, I redesigned the entire site and wrote a bit about [the new Next.js features I'm leveraging](https://keegan.codes/blog/welcome-to-my-new-blog):

<PostPreview slug="welcome-to-my-new-blog" />

My most popular post this year was [Mastering React Component Callbacks With Currying](https://keegan.codes/blog/mastering-react-component-callbacks-with-currying) and this
popularity (especailly with Google search) started my journey of optimizing SEO performance for my blog:

<PostPreview slug="mastering-react-component-callbacks-with-currying" />

Sometimes, I find myself inspired to write a post about a particular topic after doing hours of code review, and one such post was about [when to use abbreviated variable names](https://keegan.codes/blog/abbreviated-variable-names):

<PostPreview slug="abbreviated-variable-names" />

This year, I started writing about a new design system I'm building at [Kizen](https://kizen.com), and I started off by talking about [visual regression tests with Storybook](https://keegan.codes/blog/visual-regression-testing):

<PostPreview slug="visual-regression-testing" />

I continued down that path, discussing Tailwind CSS and [how to use Javascript variables with Tailwind classes](https://keegan.codes/blog/using-javascript-variables-in-tailwind):

<PostPreview slug="using-javascript-variables-in-tailwind" />

Every once in a while, I find a new pattern of building with React that I like, and this year I started using [recursively rendered React components](https://keegan.codes/blog/recursive-react-component-rendering) a lot more:

<PostPreview slug="recursive-react-component-rendering" />

To end the year, I wrote a second installment of my series on Tailwind CSS, [Generating CSS Variables From a Custom Tailwind Theme](https://keegan.codes/blog/generating-css-variables-from-a-custom-tailwind-theme):

<PostPreview slug="generating-css-variables-from-a-custom-tailwind-theme" />

All told, it would take about 109 minutes on average to read everything I wrote over the last year! Hopefully you've been keeping up ðŸ˜€

## Happy Holidays!

I hope you enjoyed reading my posts this year, and I look forward to writing more in 2024! Happy holidays and happy new year!
