I'm approaching the 5-year mark of my time with [Pinpoint](https://pinpoint.com/ 'Pinpoint'), during which I got to work on everything from [embeddable mini-apps](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/pinpoint-profile-for-developers 'Pinpoint Profile'), mobile & desktop apps, [complex web applications](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/pinpoint-4 'Pinpoint - ProductHunt'), and marketing websites & blogs, to name just a few projects. I've worked for Pinpoint in 5 different offices and 2 states, and spent some time working from home. It's been an amazing role for me to grow and learn, and discover what path I want my career to take.

That said, I'm excited to say that it is time for me to step into a new role, as a _Senior Frontend Engineer at_ [_Kizen_](https://kizen.com/ 'Kizen'). I'm looking forward to this new opportunity to learn even more and be able to focus on deep diving into frontend development for a while.

> Even though this new role is frontend-focused, I'll still be talking a lot about full-stack development here on my blog, along with the usual intermixed [electronics projects](https://keegandonley.com/blog/designing-and-building-a-raspberry-pi-based-book-quote-clock 'Electronics Project') and [other interesting things](https://keegandonley.com/blog/my-approach-to-connected-fitness 'Connected Fitness').

It's been a long time since I onboarded into a new environment and team, but I'm looking forward to this new experience. I start this role officially right at the start of the year, and I can't wait to see where 2022 takes me!
