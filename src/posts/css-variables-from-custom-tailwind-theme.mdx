Introducing Tailwind to an existing project for the first time can be a major challenge. Whether the existing
app is written using CSS modules, CSS-in-JS, or some other approach, Tailwind is a big change. On large projects,
there will likely be a transition period where multiple approaches are used at the same time. This can lead to issues with
your theme having multiple sources of truth, or your new and old components having different styles. Worse yet, you may have clashes
with Tailwind utility classes and your existing styles or third party libraries.

One way I've found to mitigate these issues is to use CSS variables to expose the Tailwind theme to the rest of the application.
This allows you to use the Tailwind build in your legacy codebase, and also gives you a single source of truth for your design tokens.

Throughout this post, I'm going to be using the example of a large, complex application built with a css-in-js approach,
that's being updated with a new design system and component library built with Tailwind. If you prefer, you can skip to **[how to generate CSS variables](#customtailwindplugins)**.

### The Legacy Code

The application being ported to Tailwind uses [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction), a css-in-js library.
Components can be written in a way similar to [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), if you're more familiar with that tool.

Here's an example of the global theme used by the css-in-js components:

```javascript
export const colors = {
  greens: {
    tea: "#D0F1BF",
    teaLight: "#D0F1BF54",
    dark: "#284D00",
  },
};
```

The component that needs to use the color imports the `colors` object from the theme, and then uses
it in the template for the various color names:

```jsx
import { colors } from "@theme";
import { styled } from "emotion";

const WrapperComponent = styled.div`
  background-color: ${theme.greens.tea};
  color: ${theme.greens.dark};
`;

const Component = () => {
  return (
    <WrapperComponent>
      This is a line of green text on a green background
    </WrapperComponent>
  );
};
```

The result is an element like this:

<div
  style={{
    color: "#284D00",
    background: "rgb(208, 241, 191)",
    padding: "0 1rem",
  }}
>
  This is a line of green text on a green background
</div>

### The New Design System

The new design system is built using Tailwind and a custom theme. These are the colors
from the design system that are used to build the new components:

```json
{
  "tea": "rgb(208, 241, 191)",
  "mint": "rgb(182, 215, 185)",
  "vine": "rgb(154, 189, 151)",
  "moss": "rgb(100, 101, 54)",
  "drab": "rgb(72, 61, 3)"
}
```

> Notice a few changes: the **dark** green color doesn’t exist, but there’s
> a similar color called **moss**. **Tea** is present in both, however in the new system, everything
> is represented in rgb.

While the application consists of a mix of the old and new components,
we don’t want **tea** represented in hex for the old css-in-js system, and in rgb in the
Tailwind theme. Design systems can change, and we want to ensure that updating the **tea** color
is easy if we change our mind later.

We also don’t want to replace every instance of **dark** with **moss**, because we
aren’t ready to test and port every portion of the application.

Since both the old and new components are being used at the same time, we need
a strategy to keep a single source of truth _for each color_.

Finally, to throw in one more curveball, I want to start moving
toward a css-first approach in as many ways as possible. That means I don't want to simply import the
`greens` object from `theme.js`.<sup>[⁂](#whynotimportthetailwindthemefileintothelegacytheme)</sup> The goal is to begin removing imported javascript, and rely on
a generated CSS bundle instead.

### The Goal

The solution I want to build, is one that allows me us slowly replace the hex values with CSS variables
representing the new colors. This way, we don’t have to maintain two sources of truth for a particular color,
and we also don’t need to modify any of the existing styled components.

```javascript
export const colors = {
  greens: {
    tea: "var(--color-green-tea)",
    teaLight: "#D0F1BF54",
    dark: "#284D00",
  },
};
```

> This would be ideal! We don't need to make any additional imports, and any develop can also look at this
> file and quickly parse out visually which colors have been ported to the new CSS variable approach, and which haven't.

So, how do we access our Tailwind theme using CSS variables
from anywhere in the new and legacy code?

## Tailwind Behavior

First, let’s look at what’s available from Tailwind out of the box. The following will take the colors defined in the design
system, and create our custom Tailwind configuration.

There's a simple color palette defined in a `theme.js` file.

```javascript
export const greens = {
  tea: "rgb(208, 241, 191)",
  mint: "rgb(182, 215, 185)",
  vine: "rgb(154, 189, 151)",
  moss: "rgb(100, 101, 54)",
  drab: "rgb(72, 61, 3)",
};
```

> In practice, this file is much larger, and contains many more color families: reds, blues, grays, etc.

The color family is imported and used in our Tailwind config:

```javascript
const { greens } = require("./theme");

module.exports = {
  content: ["./**/*.html"],
  theme: {
    colors: {
      ...greens,
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

> I'm not using `extend` in this example because my design system colors are the _only_ colors
> I want Tailwind to be aware of. You could use the [extend property](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#extending-the-default-theme) instead to preserve Tailwind's default colors.

We'll also have some small HTML markup that uses our theme colors:

```html
<div class="text-moss bg-tea">
  This is a line of green text on a green background
</div>
```

When we put that all together, we get the following displayed in the browser:

<div
  style={{
    color: "rgb(100, 101, 54)",
    background: "rgb(208, 241, 191)",
    padding: "0 1rem",
  }}
>
  This is a line of green text on a green background
</div>

Finally, this is the CSS that is generated by the Tailwind CLI:

```css
.bg-tea {
  --tw-bg-opacity: 1;
  background-color: rgb(208 241 191 / var(--tw-bg-opacity));
}

.text-moss {
  --tw-text-opacity: 1;
  color: rgb(100 101 54 / var(--tw-text-opacity));
}
```

> Tailwind automatically generated a class for each variable that's used in the files
> that are passed to the `content` array in the config. It also generated some CSS variables for controlling opacity,
> and used them in the generated classes.

Our classes are being generated and our Tailwind component works as expected, but there’s no way to
use them outside the Tailwind utility classes. In order to continue supporting the old styled components,
we need a way to expose them.

## Custom Tailwind Plugins

Tailwind plugins are able to access our theme, and can also insert additional CSS into the compiled output.
We can inline a simple plugin that will generate CSS variables for each color in our theme. They'll be
part of the `:root` selector, and will be available anywhere in the application.

```javascript
const { greens } = require("./theme");

module.exports = {
  content: ["./**/*.html"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
    colors: {
      ...greens,
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    function ({ addUtilities }) {
      addUtilities({
        ":root": Object.entries(greens).reduce((acc, [name, value]) => {
          return {
            ...acc,
            [`--color-green-${name}`]: value,
          };
        }, {}),
      });
    },
  ],
};
```

If we run the Tailwind CLI again, the compiled output has changed a bit:

```css
.bg-tea {
  --tw-bg-opacity: 1;
  background-color: rgb(208 241 191 / var(--tw-bg-opacity));
}

.text-moss {
  --tw-text-opacity: 1;
  color: rgb(100 101 54 / var(--tw-text-opacity));
}

:root {
  --color-green-tea: rgb(208, 241, 191);
  --color-green-mint: rgb(182, 215, 185);
  --color-green-vine: rgb(154, 189, 151);
  --color-green-moss: rgb(100, 101, 54);
  --color-green-drab: rgb(72, 61, 3);
}
```

Great! That's exactly what we needed in order to use our theme colors in the legacy codebase.
Here's a refresher on what we were working towards:

```javascript
export const colors = {
  greens: {
    tea: "var(--color-green-tea)",
    teaLight: "#D0F1BF54",
    dark: "#284D00",
  },
};
```

There is still a problem, however. We haven't considered the `teaLight` color yet. This color is the same
as `tea`, but with an alpha value applied. We’re now arguably in a worse-off state than we were before,
with two implementations of the tea color in the css-in-js component.

Let's go back and update our Tailwind CLI plugin to allow customizing the opacity of each color:

```javascript
function plugin({ addUtilities }) {
  addUtilities({
    ":root": Object.entries(greens).reduce((acc, [name, value]) => {
      const colorParts = value.match(/\d+/g);

      return {
        ...acc,
        [`--color-green-${name}-partial`]: colorParts.join(", "),
        [`--color-green-${name}`]: `rgb(var(--color-green-${name}-partial), var(--opacity, 1))`,
      };
    }, {}),
  });
}
```

> Instead of generating the variable like before, first the plugin generates a "partial" of the color - just
> the rgb components. Then, it uses the partial to create the rgb value.

The resulting CSS variables are quite flexible and give us a number of options for using our colors outside
of Tailwind's utility classes:

```css
.bg-tea {
  --tw-bg-opacity: 1;
  background-color: rgb(208 241 191 / var(--tw-bg-opacity));
}

.text-moss {
  --tw-text-opacity: 1;
  color: rgb(100 101 54 / var(--tw-text-opacity));
}

:root {
  --color-green-tea-partial: 208, 241, 191;
  --color-green-tea: rgb(var(--color-green-tea-partial), var(--opacity, 1));
  --color-green-mint-partial: 182, 215, 185;
  --color-green-mint: rgb(var(--color-green-mint-partial), var(--opacity, 1));
  --color-green-vine-partial: 154, 189, 151;
  --color-green-vine: rgb(var(--color-green-vine-partial), var(--opacity, 1));
  --color-green-moss-partial: 100, 101, 54;
  --color-green-moss: rgb(var(--color-green-moss-partial), var(--opacity, 1));
  --color-green-drab-partial: 72, 61, 3;
  --color-green-drab: rgb(var(--color-green-drab-partial), var(--opacity, 1));
}
```

Now, we can revisit our legacy theme one more time:

```javascript
export const colors = {
  greens: {
    tea: "var(--color-green-tea)",
    teaLight: "rgb(var(--color-green-tea-partial), 45)",
    dark: "#284D00",
  },
};
```

As the project progresses and the migration to Tailwind continues, we can slowly replace the hex values with the CSS variables, and eventually
remove the old theme entirely. In the meantime, at least we only have to define the actual value of `tea` once.

## Digging Deeper

There are a few additional things I want to note about this solution, valuable use-cases,
and decisions that were made along the way. If you've had your fill, feel free to skip to the
[conclusion](#conclusion).

### Semantic Naming

Having the generated variables is also useful for semantic naming. While we do have a `greens` color family,
we also have a `primary` color family. These semantic families are preferred over the color families,
because as we change our design system, we can swap out one color for another globally, and keep the same semantic meaning.

These semantic names look something like this in the Tailwind config:

```javascript
const { greens } = require("./theme");

const semantics = {
  "alert-primary-background": "var(--color-green-mint)",
  "alert-primary-text": "var(--color-green-moss)",
};

module.exports = {
  content: ["./**/*.html"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
    colors: {
      ...greens,
      ...semantics,
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    // Our plugin from before goes here
  ],
};
```

> Note that the semantic names are passed in as part of the color theme, alongside the color family.

The HTML can then be changed to use the new semantic classes:

```html
<div class="text-alert-primary-text bg-alert-primary-background">
  This is a line of green text on a green background
</div>
```

Just by making that one change, the generated CSS is cleaner, smaller, and it relies
solely on the custom variables being generated:

```css
.bg-alert-primary-background {
  background-color: var(--color-green-mint);
}

.text-alert-primary-text {
  color: var(--color-green-moss);
}

:root {
  --color-green-tea-partial: 208, 241, 191;
  --color-green-tea: rgba(var(--color-green-tea-partial), var(--opacity, 1));
  --color-green-mint-partial: 182, 215, 185;
  --color-green-mint: rgba(var(--color-green-mint-partial), var(--opacity, 1));
  --color-green-vine-partial: 154, 189, 151;
  --color-green-vine: rgba(var(--color-green-vine-partial), var(--opacity, 1));
  --color-green-moss-partial: 100, 101, 54;
  --color-green-moss: rgba(var(--color-green-moss-partial), var(--opacity, 1));
  --color-green-drab-partial: 72, 61, 3;
  --color-green-drab: rgba(var(--color-green-drab-partial), var(--opacity, 1));
}
```

This is my favorite part of the solution. Every variable has its purpose, and
the CSS is generated in a way that's easy to read and understand. Additionally, the opacity
logic is still preserved, and we can use the `--opacity` variable to change the opacity of any color.
I recently wrote about [passing CSS variables to elements using inline styles](https://keegan.codes/blog/using-javascript-variables-in-tailwind),
and this is a great example of how that can be useful.

### Why Not Import the Tailwind Theme File Into the Legacy Theme?

Above, I simplified a bit about why I didn't want to import the Tailwind theme file into the legacy theme, like this:

```javascript
import { greens } from "@design-system/theme.js";

export const colors = {
  greens: {
    tea: greens.tea,
    teaLight: "#D0F1BF54",
    dark: "#284D00",
  },
};
```

There are a few reasons for this:

1. It's not "portable". In reality, the theme is comprised of many color families across many files.
   Being able to copy and paste varous parts of the theme during refactors is a convenience I'm not willing to give up.
2. Importing `theme.js` from the Tailwind library is not a pattern I want to encourage in any way. The entire goal of this
   project is moving **away** from importing javascript to control the look of the app. Even though the legacy theme is already using javascript,
   it would be a step backward to introduce a pattern in the code where our brand new CSS theme is used like this.
3. It's not a good separation of concerns. The `theme.js` file is an implementation detail of the design system. It's not part of the public API,
   and as the design system evolves, we may want to move files around, or change how the theme is defined and structured entirely.
   The CSS variables that are emitted, however, _are_ part of the public API. Those are the only thing that should be relied on from outside the design system.

### What Other Variables are Useful to Generate?

I don't only use this approach for colors. It's useful for font-sizes, spacing, and any other value that's used in the legacy codebase.

In all, I have a plugin that takes in my custom theme, and outputs around 500 unique CSS variables, allowing
the theme files and their design tokens to drive the Tailwind generation, and in turn the legacy codebase as sections get ported over.

## Conclusion

I'm continually learning new patterns and approaches to using Tailwind, and I hope this was interesting and useful to you. I'd love to hear
your thoughts on this approach, and if you have something similar in your Tailwind build!
