Currying is a technique in functional programming to break down function call arguments.
A function is transformed from having <em>multiple arguments</em>,
to being a <em>sequence of single-argument calls</em>. This pattern breaks down functions
into smaller, more focused functions, often making code easier to read (and thus
maintain).

Currying isn’t unique to Javascript, but since I’m focusing on use-cases
with React in this post, I’ll be focusing on Javascript in my example code.

## Currying: A Basic Example

Before we get to React, though, here’s a basic example. Let’s start with
a simple `add` function, that sums two integers together:

```jsx
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

add(1, 2); // 3
```

Now, here’s the curried version:

```jsx
const add = (a) => {
  return (b) => {
    return a + b;
  };
};

add(1)(2); // 3
```

> The curried version still performs the same function, but be sure to note the
> important difference in how the call is structured, with `add(1, 2)` in the original
> function, and `add(1)(2)` in the curried version. Instead of calling one function with
> two arguments, we’re calling two functions in sequence, each with one argument.

## Applications in React

It may or may not be immediately obvious why this pattern is valuable, so let’s
look at a real application in React. Here we have three buttons, that perform
actions on a number (go ahead, try it out):

<CurryingExample />

### Basic Approach

Here's the most basic version of the source code for the above interaction: three buttons, three callbacks:

```jsx
const Math = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(1);

  const handleIncrement = () => {
    setValue((v) => v + 1);
  };

  const handleDecrement = () => {
    setValue((v) => v - 1);
  };

  const handleDouble = () => {
    setValue((v) => v * 2);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <p>Value is {value}</p>
      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={handleDecrement}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={handleDouble}>Double</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

This is often the "knee-jerk" first approach, but let’s think about
maintainability for a moment. Imagine we want to add some additional state, like a variable
`hasChanged` to indicate the value has been updated. We’d have to set it in three places!
Not so good in terms of ease of maintenance.

In the next example, we'll add in that new state
variable while improving the code a bit.

### Using a Single Handler

Here's another common and fairly simple approach: using a single function that takes an additional
argument, like an action to perform. If you want to add some complexity after or before
updating the value, it's easy to do in just one place:

```jsx
const Math = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(1);
  const [hasChanged, setHasChanged] = useState(false);

  const handleClick = (action) => {
    setHasChanged(true); // New logic that runs no matter which action is taken

    if (action === "increment") {
      return setValue((v) => v + 1);
    }
    if (action === "decrement") {
      return setValue((v) => v - 1);
    }
    if (action === "double") {
      return setValue((v) => v * 2);
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <p>Value is {value}</p>
      <button onClick={() => handleClick("increment")}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => handleClick("decrement")}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={() => handleClick("double")}>Double</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

Now, we only have one callback, but in order to call `handleClick` , we need to
create an anonymous function for each `onClick` handler, in order to pass the field.

This isn't ideal, and we can do better!

### Applying Principles of Currying

It's finally time to apply the principles of currying we learned earlier, and write this handler
in a way that’s easy to understand and maintain:

```jsx
const Math = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(1);

  const clickHandlerFor = (action) => {
    return (event) => {
      event.stopPropagation(); // New logic that runs no matter which action is taken

      if (action === "increment") {
        return setValue((v) => v + 1);
      }
      if (action === "decrement") {
        return setValue((v) => v - 1);
      }
      if (action === "double") {
        return setValue((v) => v * 2);
      }
    };
  };

  return (
    <>
      <p>Value is {value}</p>
      <button onClick={clickHandlerFor("increment")}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={clickHandlerFor("decrement")}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={clickHandlerFor("double")}>Double</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

> In this curried version, each `onClick` handler is a function that returns a function. If we think outside of React for a
> moment like we did at the beginning, we can see this is just like currying our `add` function from earlier! Instead of
> calling `clickHandler("increment", event)`, this new code is effectively calling `clickHandlerFor("increment")(event)`.

### Input Example

This works well for input components too!

```jsx
const Form = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [termsAccepted, setTermsAccepted] = useState(false);

  const inputHandlerFor = (field) => {
    return (ev) => {
      if (field === "name") {
        return setName(ev.target.value);
      }
      if (field === "terms") {
        return setTerms(ev.target.checked);
      }
    };
  };

  return (
    <form>
      <input type="text" onChange={inputHandlerFor("name")} value={name} />
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        onChange={inputHandlerFor("terms")}
        checked={termsAccepted}
      />
    </form>
  );
};
```

> Without currying, our inputs with their callbacks would be something like this:
>
> ```jsx
> <input onChange={(event) => inputHandler("name", event)} />
> ```
>
> The curried approach is far more concise and still easy to read and understand!

### Mapping Example

If you want to access the data from the item you clicked, a curried
click handler is perfect for the job:

```jsx
const data = [
  { id: 1, name: "John" },
  { id: 2, name: "Jane" },
  { id: 3, name: "Joe" },
];

const clickHandler = (data) => (event) => {
  console.log("clicked on", data.id);
};

return data.map((dataItem) => {
  return <button onClick={clickHandler(dataItem)}>{d.name}</button>;
});
```

> Like before, this call is effectively `clickHandler(dataItem)(event)`,
> which in its uncurried format would be `clickHandler(dataItem, event)`.

## Conclusion

Currying is an advanced functional programming technique that applies to many languages!
Hopefully it's now more clear how it can be used to improve your React applications, and
any other code you find yourself working on.
