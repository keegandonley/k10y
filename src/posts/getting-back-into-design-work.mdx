Hobbies - when they overlap with your career as much as mine do, it can be difficult to keep a differentiation between work and play. Historically I'm pretty bad at that, but I'm trying to make more of an effort to do things "for fun" - and keep those things separate from things I do to earn a living.

For a while, I was pretty into [Dribbble's weekly warm up](https://dribbble.com/stories/2019/09/03/introducing-dribbble-s-weekly-warm-up) as a way to get inspiration for small graphic design projects that were just for fun, and not something I was working on as a means of income.

Life got in the way for a while (as it so often does), but I want to start making more of these, and figured I'd start posting them here too. Here's the last one I did, for the prompt "Create a custom 404 Illustration":

I threw this together quickly in [Figma](https://www.figma.com), which I'm finding I lean on more and more these days not just for mockups but actual design work.

Here's another one from a while back, also in Figma, where the prompt was to redesign one of my favorite candy bars:

I'll hopefully have the time to work on more of these, since it's important to me to keep graphic design at least partially as a hobby, since I find it quite relaxing and fun to work on small projects like these.

I've already started thinking about the current prompt, and will work on something soon ðŸŽ‰:

## Update November 14, 2021

The most recent shot I worked on was for [Logi's official playoff prompt](https://dribbble.com/shots/16648804-SMALLER-SMARTER-MIGHTIER 'Logi Dribbble'): _Smaller. Smarter. Mightier._ I thought an ant dominating a strength test carnival game was a good embodiment of this:

This was my first animated shot, and I enjoyed trying to make it! The individual frames were made in Figma, then animated into a GIF using Photoshop. You can see my shot [on Dribbble here](https://dribbble.com/shots/16854958-Small-but-Mighty 'Dribbble Shot')!
