Happy holidays! 2022 is almost over, and it's been a fantastic year! There were a lot of changes as I started a new role as a senior front-end engineer at [Kizen](/blog/beginning-a-new-chapter-of-my-career-with-kizen "Kizen Announcement"). This was the first full year I was operating my blog, and I had the opportunity to write about lots of topics that are interesting to me, from [fitness](/blog/my-connected-fitness-tools-part-2 "Fitness Part 2") to [debugging software](/blog/debugging-code-using-git-bisect "Debug with Git Bisect") to [recent innovations in AI](/blog/a-quick-look-at-openai-dall-e-2 "DALL-E 2 Intro").

Thank you to everyone who has supported my new endeavor in writing! I will take some time off from content creation until the new year, but I'm excited about what 2023 holds. I'm going to continue writing about all the things that interest me, sending out my newsletter, and adding to my reading list!

Happy holidays, and a happy new year!
