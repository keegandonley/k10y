I've never like giving up control of my data, and how it's presented. You can see that philosophy
in how I run this blog, and how I design most of my projects. From the beginning, I knew I wanted
a place where I could share my thoughts, ideas, and projects, and I knew it wasn't going to be
something like Medium or Substack. It's important to me that my corner of the internet can live on
with very little control from any platform, company, or person. Even if this iteration of my site
is eventualy upgraded, replaced, migrated, or otherwise changed, it's always going to be in the same
place. I host it on Vercel and built this version with Next.js, but platforms and frameworks can
come and go. My content is all written in Markdown and it's pretty portable if I need to rebuild
my site. In fact, I've done it a few times before.

Most of the content here I have complete control over as well. Images are served from Cloudflare R2
for now, but I can always move to a different storage platform. Videos are served from my own infrastructure
as well. I've avoided embedding YouTube videos or other external content, since I don't control what happens
to my videos, and whatever provider I'm using could deactivate my account or change how it works, breaking
tons of historical content.

I have had one gap in my strategy though, and it's a pretty big one in my opinion.

## I Don't Own My Fitness Data

For a long time now, I've been excited about [connected fitness](https://keegan.codes/blog/my-connected-fitness-tools-part-2).
I've also recently redeveloped a love for cycling an got pretty into road biking.

In order to visualize, share, and otherwise analyze the results of my workouts, rides, hikes, or anything
else that I do, I have come to rely heavily on third parties. Strava is one of the main platforms that I use,
both to share my rides with fellow enthusiasts, or to keep track of my training over time, and just look back
on it for fun! This works fine, but given my thoughts on data ownership, it always bothered me that I didn't have
more control over how I presented that data. Originally, I had started building a side project that used the Strava API
to render server components of my activities so that I could embed them here on my blog. Then, I got an email a
couple days ago:

> Hello Keegan
>
> Weâ€™re reaching out to inform you of a change that affects how third-party apps connected to Strava may display
> certain information. This update, effective on November 11th, is part of our commitment to privacy and transparency
> across all connected apps and devices.
>
> Third-party apps will now only be allowed to display Strava activity data related to a specific user to that user.
> Partners will be required to update their app within 30 days of November 11th to align with this new standard.

They expanded a bit on the changes in a [press release](https://press.strava.com/articles/updates-to-stravas-api-agreement), but
this severely limits what developers are allowed to do with Strava data, including projects like the one I was working on.

## Taking Back Ownership

Now, I'm not saying that Strava is holding my data hostage or not letting me analyze it, but this change
was the push I needed to finally work on applying my same philosophy of data ownership to my fitness data. My
first focus has been on presenting ride and hike data here on my site. I could use Strava's embed code, but
that's still putting all the control in Strava's hands. If a month from now, or 5 years from now, they decide to
disable embeds, all my old content will be broken, and these recent changes (especially with the short notice period)
don't give me confidence in that regard. So, I built a server component that can take my raw workout data and embed
it here on the site!

<WorkoutGrid>
  <Workout
    distanceFeet={92822.4}
    elevationFeet={3343}
    gpxUrl="https://fitness.static.donley.xyz/tour-of-watopia-stage-4.gpx"
    watopia
  />
  <Workout
    distanceFeet={328891.2}
    timeSeconds={14607}
    elevationFeet={3343}
    gpxUrl="https://fitness.static.donley.xyz/realale2024.gpx"
  />
</WorkoutGrid>

The component works by downloading and parsing a GPX file, a format used for storing workout route data, including GPS location,
elevation, heart rate, cycling power, and more. I can host these files myself, and the component doesn't rely on
Strava, or anyone else, to display or calulate the data. The only service I rely on is Mapbox, but I can always swap them
out for a different mapping service if needed.

I was even able to add some features I think have been missing, like showing the virtual map for Zwift indoor rides,
rather that overlaying the GPS track in the ocean. This project will continue to evolve over time as I expand the features,
support more workout types, and improve automation for getting things uploaded and stored on my own infrastructure. The end goal
is to be able to have a feed of activities here much like Strava, but that I own and control. With video and photo embeds,
I'm confident I can deliver an even richer and more flexible experience than many of the big platforms offer.

Zwift, the virtual training platform I use when I can't ride outside, lets me record videos and photos during the ride.
Here's an example:

<video width="100%" height="auto" controls preload="metadata">
  <source
    src="https://video.static.donley.xyz/zwift-sprint.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.

I have big plans for this new integration with my raw fitness data, including map overlays, data graphs,
and rich media like photos and videos. Having full control has always been my goal, but recent developments
just encouraged me to finally do the work, or at least get started.
