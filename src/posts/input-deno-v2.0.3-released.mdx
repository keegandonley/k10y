After a long hiatus from maintaining my deno input handling library, [input-deno](https://deno.land/x/input@2.0.3 "Deno Land Link"), I've published a new version with a new input handling type and a critical bug fix for private input!

This version switches to use a deferred promise for handling private input (a mode where the output is not displayed in the console as it is typed). Using this same approach, I also implemented a `wait` method, that can be used to prompt the user to "press any key to continue".

You can now use the following:

```javascript
import Input from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keegandonley/input-deno/master/index.ts";

const input = new Input();

await input.wait();
const result = await input.question("Say something: ", false);
console.log("You said", result);
```

to yield the following output:

```
    Press any key to continue...
    Say something: Hello, world!
    You said Hello, world!
```

Using this new deferred promise also fixes an issue where the program could crash when using private input.

> Bear in mind that this new `wait` method needs to be run with the `--unstable` flag, or it will have no effect.

You can refer to the [issue on Github](https://github.com/keegandonley/input-deno/issues/21 "Github Link") and any feedback is always welcome!
