Last week, I wanted to make a cocktail, and realized I didn't have all the ingredients
to make any sort of drink that I knew of. I hadn't restocked the bar in a while, so I was working with
limited options. I went to a spot down the road for a whiskey sour, but got to thinking about building
an application that could take all the ingredients I have on-hand, and recommend what I can make. And so,
[Thirsty Bot](https://thirsty.bot) was born.

It's a simple application that lets you select a list of ingredients you have on-hand, and then uses an LLM to come
up with one beverage that can be made with either all, or a subset of those ingredients.

Here's one of my favorite drinks, created from my list of ingredients (after restocking the bar of course), along with an
enticing photo:

Sometimes it comes up with some non-traditional drinks that I might not have thought of:

It's not perfect all the time; I've definitely thrown some weird ingredients at it and gotten
some strange results, but it's fun nonetheless to see what can be made with a collection of what I have
available!

I'm going to be doing a deep dive into how I built this, how long it took, what I learned, and the tools I used, so look for that
later this week!

In the meantime, go ahead and try it out for yourself at [thirsty.bot](https://thirsty.bot)! Every account gets 10 credits for free,
which are good for either 5 recipes with images, or 10 recipes with no images (I recommend the images though - they're fun!)

> This week, as a reader of my blog, you can use the code `KEEGANCODES10` for 10 additional free credits!
