Last week during a trip to Yosemite for 2 nights, I had a chance to try out my new camera for some night sky photography for the first time.

I use a _Sony a6100_ so this isn't a full-frame camera; with a crop sensor like this I'm limited in what I can do, but I still got some good shots and had a good time! The lens for these was a _Tamron_ 20mm f/2.8 prime lens (I'm working on a budget here).

These were all taken from Glacier Point above the Yosemite valley, at approximately _7200 feet_.

I tried to stick to an under 8-second exposure to minimize star trails, but I did go up to 30 seconds on some while I was experimenting and playing around.

This was my first real attempt at photography like this; while I have tried before I didn't have the right equipment (tripod, remote shutter release, etc). Here's a result from my other attempt versus now. I'm pretty proud of the difference!

Glacier Point is one my favorite places in the world that I've seen stars from and it was a lot of fun shooting these! Here are a few more photos from the trip to check out:
