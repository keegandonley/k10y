I love attending developer conferences. They're an amazing opportunity to network, learn from others,
get re-energized about our industry, be insipired by what people are working on, and discover what cool
new things are possible.

I just got back a few days ago from [React Miami](https://www.reactmiami.com/) and I'm still processing
all of the great conversations I had and people I met. The conference was amazing, and I'll be adding
it to my schedule for future years. A huge thanks to the sponsors, volunteers, and the organizers
[Michelle Bakels](https://twitter.com/michellebakels), [Gabe Greenberg](https://twitter.com/gabe_g2i),
and [Jos Gerards](https://twitter.com/josgerards88). Conferences like this are not easy to put on by any means,
and I appreciate all the work that goes into them every year.

## The Talks

The conference talks at events like this are usually one of the prime attractions. Between CSS tips from [Una](https://twitter.com/Una),
advice from [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) about how to stop lying to your users, or
[Christopher "Vjeux" Chedeau](https://twitter.com/Vjeux)'s dive into how to succeed at open source, there was a lot to take in!
I can't easily pick favorites, but here's a sampling of some of what was presented during the weekend:

### What's New in CSS?

Or, how can we replace JavaScript with CSS?

Are you familiar with the [popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API)? Think about the last time you
had to build a modal UI. Probably lot's of Javascript, right? [Una](https://twitter.com/Una)'s talk focused on what's coming
to the browser (or in this case, already supported!) to help us write less Javascript. One of these powerful tools is the `popover`
API. Instead of needing a bunch of Javascript to handle modals, why not just do it with HTML?

```html
<button popovertarget="mypopover">Toggle the popover</button>
<div id="mypopover" popover>Popover content</div>
```

Popovers handle many of the concerns of a modal for us, without having to code anything at all!

- Provides promotion to the top layer (no more z-index fighting)
- Light-dismiss functionality built in (i.e. click outside/escape to close)
- Focus management
- Keyboard accessibility built in
- Semantically connected to its trigger
- Can be animated in Chromium
