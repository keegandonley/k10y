It seems like just yesterday I was at [React Miami](/blog/react-miami-2024-recap), and now here I
have another conference recap for you! Last month, I attended Render in Atlanta, Georgia and had
a great time! The networking opportunities were great, the talks were engaging, and there
were plenty of happy hours to go around.

## Favorite Talks

I always start these posts talking about some of my favorite talks. Since I'm working on building
an integration platform at Kizen, as well as a design system, I decided to focus on talks around
design systems and Javascript security.

### Building Successful Design Systems

Working on an internal design system has taught me that a lot of thought goes into building the perfect system
for your organization's needs. A talk by [Dan Mall](https://danmall.com/) got into the details of what makes a successful
design system.

### CSS: From the Creator Himself

We got to hear from [Håkon Wium Lie](https://www.wiumlie.no/en), who created the first version of CSS back in 1994.
He told a lot of stories of his time at CERN and how the language, and the web at large, came to be.

To celebrate the 30th birthday of CSS, we went through the history of web technologies and browser
support for different features, and heard some stories about trying to get browser vendors to pass
the [Acid2 Test](https://www.webstandards.org/files/acid2/test.html#top).

It was great to hear from Håkon directly about how things got started, and what it took to get to
where we are now!

### Hostile Javascript

I've been working on an integration platform for Kizen for a while now, and it's essentially a way
to run Javascript plugins that can interact with our app, to integrate with third parties (like a dialer platform).
Security has been at the forefront of that project. Introducing an arbitrary code execution engine on purpose
means I had to be very careful with our approach, and learning about historical attacks and the vectors they used
is crucial to inform my decisions building this project!

[Todd Gardner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddhgardner/) talked about some of the classic exploits, and how they worked.

We learned about platforms like [Coinimp](https://www.coinimp.com/), a Javascript framework for mining crypocurrency
on users' computers while they browse your site. You really shouldn't do this on your own site, but if it's injected into
a site you don't own through a supply chain or XSS attack, it becomes an exploit. 

> __Thinking about my integration platform__: A good code review process for new integrations can prevent developers from writing a malicious
> plugin that's only goal is to mine crypo in the background.

Todd talked about keylogging attacks, like [Magecart](https://www.akamai.com/glossary/what-is-magecart), a web skimmer
that was injected into over 70,000 online stores at one point, stealing credit card and other sensitive information via a
keylogger.

> __Thinking about my integration platform__: The Javascript for a plugin runs in a dedicated worker. Every function for each plugin
> creates a new worker to execute in, so plugin code can't do things like attach global event handlers or mutate the DOM.

## Networking

This year, as always, I had a strong focus on meeting new people and networking. I always build
a custom webpage for each conference I go to. This year was [keegan.codes/render24](https://keegan.codes/render24).
I took it a step further this time, and printed some stickers with a QR code to this page, via
my link tracking service so I could track how many scans I got throughout the day.
