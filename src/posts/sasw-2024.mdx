A couple weeks ago, I was invited to speak on a panel at [San Antonio Startup Week](https://sasw.co/) called _"Thriving as a Shoftware Engineer."_
The panel was hosted and moderated by [Geeks && Drinks](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-umecjcqo/), a local community organization in San Antonio.

Along with my fellow panelists, we discussed the current state of the software industry, including hiring practices,
the prevalence of AI, and what it looks like trying to get your first job in tech today.

## AI Hot Takes

As a little ice breaker, we started off talking about AI and any "hot takes" we might have on the topic. I've been pretty
voval in the past that I'm a big supporter of AI coding auto-complete tools, like GitHub Copilot. Where I lose faith in AI is
when it's asked to create entire applications, with complex requirements and constraints.

## The Current Landscape

A discussion about the software industry wouldn't be complete without talking about the current state of hiring.
It's no secret that there is a lot of competition out there for software roles. A lot of that competition is due to the
state of the market with recent high-profile layoffs at big tech firms, however there are also just more people entering
this field than ever before. With alternate forms of education like coding bootcamps, online learning, or certifications
that don't require a full computer science degree, breaking into tech is more acessible than ever.

This means it's more important than ever to stand out when looking for a job. But, in my opinion, it's easier to do this
than you might think at first.

Lately, I've seen an increase in the number of candidates whose skills don't match their resume (read: lying on resumes).
Now, there's nothing wrong with applying for a job you aren't fully qualified for. In fact, I recommend applying for any job
that you think might be a fit, even if you don't meet every requirement. However, that's different from lying on a resume.

I've performed a number of interviews in recent years, either for people applying to work on my team, or mock interviews for friends or
students. I've been continually surprised by the number of people who have a whole list of languages on their resume, but can't even
write one line of code in some of them.

**How to stand out?** Be able to back up what's on paper with hard skills. If you come in with 8 years of experience with JavaScript
on your resume, be able to demonstrate your skills. Generally, in my experience, that's enough to make you stand out against many
candidates right off the bat.
