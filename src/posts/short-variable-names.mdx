Back when I was in college working for Appcelerator and Pinpoint, I also worked
part-time as a teaching assistant at Santa Rosa Junior College, where I spent a lot
of time running labs, debugging C++ and Python with students, and grading a few
hundred assignments every week. Needless to say, I read a _lot_ of code!
