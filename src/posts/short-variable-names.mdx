Back when I was in college working for Appcelerator and Pinpoint, I also worked
part-time as a teaching assistant at Santa Rosa Junior College, where I spent a lot
of time running labs, debugging C++ and Python with students, and grading a few
hundred assignments every week. All that to say, I read a _lot_ of code! I had a number
of guidelines for grading assignments, but one of the most controversial ones was variable
naming conventions.

Most of the classes I worked on were introductory programming classes, so the students
were given pretty strict code quality guidelines. The variable naming conventions were
one of the most important ones, and the students were told to use descriptive variable
names _always_, and _never_ abbreviate anything except for loop counters.

If you've ever worked on a codebase with a lot of abbreviations, you know how hard it
can be to read and understand. Abbreviations are often ambiguous, and it's hard to
understand what they mean, especially if you didn't write them, or they're non-standard
abbreviations. That's the point this rule was trying to make, and it's a good lesson
for students to learn early on in their studies.

## What about the real world?

In the real world, things aren't always so black and white. I wouldn't want to waste
a lot of time being overly prescriptive about variable names, but we also don't want to end
up with a codebase full of abbreviations that are hard to understand. This slows the team
(or even just me on solo projects) down, and makes it harder to maintain the codebase.

So, when is it okay to use abbreviations in naming? I have a few scenarios
where I'm fine with abbreviations and short names. The following are the criteria I use to decide whether or not to
use an abbreviation, and I generally apply them when I do code review as well.

#### Standard Abbreviations

The first one is a bit obvious, but computing is not without abbreviations. There are a number of abbreviations that are baked into languages
and nobody would expect these to be avoided. Take this C++ example:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string userInput;

    std::cout << "Please enter some text: ";
    std::getline(std::cin, userInput);

    std::cout << "You entered: " << userInput << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

> We've got lots of abbreviations here! `iostream`, `int`, `std`, `cout`, `cin`, and `endl` are all abbreviations.

You wouldn't expect these to "count" as abbreviations per se, but you'd be surprised some of the hoops
I saw students jump through to avoid using them, usually to prove a point that the rule was dumb. (For real, I once had a student submit
code full of preprocessor directives like `#define STANDARD_INPUT_STREAM std::cin` and `#define END_LINE std::endl`)

Now that I've covered my bases with the obvious and a bit silly, let's move on to some more realistic scenarios.
