Back when I was in college working on my computer science degree, I also worked
part-time as a teaching assistant at Santa Rosa Junior College, where I spent a lot
of time running labs, debugging C++ and Python with students, and grading a few
hundred assignments every week. All that to say, I read a _lot_ of code! I had a number
of guidelines (not written by me) for grading assignments, but one of the most controversial ones was variable
naming conventions.

Most of the classes I worked on were introductory programming classes, so the students
were given pretty strict code quality guidelines. The variable naming conventions were
one of the most important ones, and the students were told to use descriptive variable
names _always_, and _never_ abbreviate anything except for loop counters.

If you've ever worked on a codebase with a lot of abbreviations, you know how hard it
can be to read and understand. Abbreviations are often ambiguous, and it's hard to
understand what they mean, especially if you didn't write them, or they're non-standard
abbreviations. That's the point this rule was trying to make, and it's a good lesson
for students to learn early on in their studies.

## What about the real world?

In the real world, things aren't always so black and white. I wouldn't want to waste
a lot of time being overly prescriptive about variable names, but we also don't want to end
up with a codebase full of abbreviations that are hard to understand. This slows the team
(or even just me on solo projects) down, and makes it harder to maintain the codebase.

So, when is it okay to use abbreviations in naming? I have a few scenarios
where I'm fine with abbreviations and short names. The following are the criteria I use to decide whether or not to
use an abbreviation, and I generally apply them when I do code reviews as well to try to keep a codebase
in good shape.

#### Standard Abbreviations

The first one is a bit obvious, but computing is not without abbreviations. There are a number of abbreviations that are baked into languages
and nobody would expect these to be avoided. Take this C++ example:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string userInput;

    std::cout << "Please enter some text: ";
    std::getline(std::cin, userInput);

    std::cout << "You entered: " << userInput << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

> We've got lots of abbreviations here! `iostream`, `int`, `std`, `cout`, `cin`, and `endl` are all abbreviations.

You wouldn't expect these to "count" as abbreviations per se, but you'd be surprised some of the hoops
I saw students jump through to avoid using them, usually to prove a point that the rule was dumb. I once had a student submit
code full of preprocessor directives like `#define STANDARD_INPUT_STREAM std::cin` and `#define END_LINE std::endl` so that they could
then use `STANDARD_INPUT_STREAM` and `END_LINE` in their code. I know what they were trying to prove, but it was a bit silly and made the
code nearly impossible to follow. Needless to say, avoiding abbreviations can go too far.

Now that I've covered my bases with the obvious and a bit silly, let's move on to some more realistic scenarios.

#### Well-Accepted Abbreviations and Acronyms

There are a number of abbreviations and acronyms that are well-accepted in the world. These are usually
okay to abbreviate in code as well. For example, abbreviations like `min`, `max`, `approx`, etc. My goal
here is to avoid ambiguity and confusion, so if the abbreviation is well-known and unambiguous, I'm generally
fine with it.

#### Convention

Many languages have conventions for how to name things. For example, loops often use `i`, `j`, and `k` as
loop counters. In JavaScript, `el` is often used for element and `idx` for index. These
typically serve to simplify code and make it easier to read.

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  for (let j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
    console.log(`i: ${i}, j: ${j}`);
  }
}
```

> This is a pretty common pattern, and it's pretty easy to understand what's going on here.

#### Small Scope

For a long time, I've followed the rule of thumb that the longer a variable is in scope, the more descriptive
it should be. If I'm writing a small mapping function, I'll often use a single-letter variable because it's
only in scope for a single line.

```javascript
const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const even = data.filter((d) => d % 2 === 0);
```

> Normally, I'd advise against using `d` as a variable name abbreviation of `data`, but in this case, it's
> only in scope for a moment and it's nearly impossible to misundertand its use.

Once a variable is in scope for a couple lines, I'll start to lengthen the variable names.

```javascript
const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const result = data.reduce((acc, curr) => {
  if (curr % 2 === 0) {
    acc.push(curr);
  }
  return acc;
}, []);
```

> Here, I've used `acc` and `curr` as abbreviations for `accumulator` and `current`, respectively. These are
> still pretty short, but they're in scope for a few lines, so I've lengthened them a bit.

## Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, being overly prescriptive with naming conventions can be a waste of time. It's useful
to have some guidelines, but there are always exceptions. I've found that the guidelines above are a good starting
point, but I make exceptions when it makes sense.

If you really prefer short variable names, keeping your scopes small and composing code into smaller units will go a
long ways towards making your code more readable and maintable even with abbreviated names.
