A few days ago I [introduced Thirsty Bot](https://keegan.codes/blog/introducing-thirsty-bot), an AI-powered app
that helps you find cocktail recipes based on the ingredients you have at home. I built the app in 72 hours as part of a
litle personal "hackathon", and I learned a lot in the process. In this post, I'll share some of what I learned, and do
a deeper dive into how it all works.

## Thirsty Bot

I wanted the design to be reminiscent of an art-deco bar.
I really like some bars around town that use deep green and gold, so that's what I went with:

<Caption>
  The hompage has a series of arched bars with various bottles on the shelves.
  They're randomly generated on each load for some variety.

![](thirsty-bot-deep-dive:build-frameless.png)

<Caption>
  The builder has an ingredient list, and some icons to indicate your
  selections. Over time, I've added a few unique icons as fun easter eggs.

## My Build Process

I built the app in a weekend, over approximately 72 hours. I wanted to treat this like my
days participating in hackathons, but just a bit longer. Each day, I set myself some goals
and tracked how much time I spent on the project.

### Day 1

<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faClockSevenThirty} /> 7h 40m

On the first day, I finished my day job around 4pm and I started on Thirsty Bot by creating a basic Next.js app. I did some basic styling with
Tailwind, and then started on auth. I wanted to build in auth early, so it wouldn't be a major
lift later.

By the end of the day, I had an early iteration of my prompt working, a backend that could return a recipe
and an image, and the ability to see your finished product. No loading states yet, and the selection of available
ingredients was tiny.

### Day 2

Day 2 was my main building day. I had the MVP/proof of concept done, and sent to a couple friends
overnight to get some early testing done. The day was focused on details - adding a lot more ingredients
to the database, supporting mobile screen sizes, adding loading states and intersitial modals, things like
that. I also added the ability to see your list of past generations.

The second half of my demo video below shows the mobile experience.

The second day is also when I cut over from the development instance of my authentication with Clerk. I also
merged by development branch on Planetscale into production. "Going live" took a good chunk of my time.

### Day 3

<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faClockSixThirty} /> 6h 21m

The third day, I had everything working smoothly, except no ability to add additional credits to your
account. I spent the majority of the morning working on integration with Stripe using payment links. I went
with the no-code solution since I didn't need the integration to be very complex. Through Stripe, I was able to
handle discount codes to act as vouchers for credits. I wanted to build a first-party voucher system, but didn't
have the time to dedicate yet.

## Further Reading: Application Architecture

Phew! This has been a long one! If you need to take a break and use [Thirsty Bot](https://thirsty.bot) to recommend
a cocktail, this is a good stopping point. After the break, I'm going to get into the architectural
details of the application. We'll look at some code, evaluate the tools I used, and go over some
mistakes I made and what I learned. If that sounds interesting, keep reading!

### Database

My database is [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) on the smallest plan, `PS-10`. I use Planetscale for this site (keegan.codes), so it made
sense to me to use it for Thirsty Bot as well since it was familiar and I could build quickly. I wanted to leverage Planetscale's branching and safe
schema changes as well, since I knew I'd be adjusting the database schema a lot as I iterated quickly and built the app in public.

<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faGraduationCap} /> I learned a lot about how branching works
on Planetscale. At first, I forgot to think about moving data from a branch to the
production database, so I had to spend some time migrating data after I set up all
the categories and options. Note to self: don't accidentally create a ton of data
on a branch instead of the production instance.

  }}
/>

### AI Tools

I tried quite a few different models and platforms in order to settle on how I could generate the recipes. They all had their strengths
and weaknesses, but here was some of what I discovered:

- **gpt-3.5-turbo**: The biggest problem I had with gpt-3.5-turbo is that it would make a drink with literally anything, no matter
  how much I adjusted the prompt. If I told it I had eggs, soy sauce, and water, it would tell me I could make an egg, soy sauce, and water
  martini. Not a great representation of what a cocktail should be. I needed it to respond that certain combinations of ingredients just
  aren't possible.
- **llama-2-70b**: I tried this one out through Replicate. Llama-2-70b solved my problem of creating drinks with weird ingredients, but I could
  not coerce this model into only using the ingredients provided. It continually added ingredients that weren't provided. That's no good either.
- **gpt-4**: This got me the closest. Gpt-4 mostly respected my rules, and would return a token "IMPOSSIBLE" when it decided the
  ingredients couldn't go together. It also only vary rarely added ingredients. Sometimes it would add simple syrup when it wasn't included, but that
  was rare. The biggest problem I had was that it would make things that were non-cocktails. For example, if I provided coffee beans as garnish,
  irish cream, vodka, and espresso, it would tell me to grind the beans, brew a cup of coffee, and add cream. Not quite what I was going for.

In the end, I settled on gpt-4. It's a bit more expensive, but it seemed best suited for my task. With a lot of iteration on my prompt with the
instructions, I was able to get reliable results. I had to change my input format a lot, and write a pretty long set of instructions, but
I was able to stop getting non-provided ingredients, stopped getting things that aren't cocktails, and was able to handle a set of ingredients
that isn't possible.

Here's the format gpt-4 receives the chosen ingredients in:

```text
(Spirits: Vodka, Rye Whiskey, Tequila)
(Liqueurs: Triple Sec, Amaretto, Irish Cream)
(Garnish: Espresso Beans, Lemon, Mint)
(Mixer: Cola, Espresso, Tonic Water)
(Wine: Champagne Wine, Red Wine)
```

<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faForward} /> In the future, I'd like to move to gpt-3.5-turbo.
I'm fairly confident it could work, but it would take some fine tuning of the model,
something I'm not familiar with yet. I'm hoping to look into this down the road to
save on cost, and make things faster.

For the images to go with each recipe, I used DALL·E 3. I've been using [DALLE·2 since the beginning](https://keegan.codes/blog/a-quick-look-at-openai-dall-e-2),
but had no experience when I started with DALL·E 3. It was surprisingly easy to take the output from gpt-4, and
use it to generate a prompt for an image. Here's one I really like:

![](thirsty-bot:cocktail-1.png?limit)

<Caption>

Maple Old Fashioned

</Caption>

<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faForward} /> I'm still working on tuning how I direct DALL·E
3. My prompt right now includes the steps to make the drink, as well as the name.
I had better results getting a drink that matched the text this way, however it's
difficult to make DALL·E 3 leave off text, and not show the steps themselves in the
image:

![](thirsty-bot:cocktail-3.png?limit)

<Caption>

Whiskey Smash

</Caption>

<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faGraduationCap} /> I learned that negative prompting doesn't
work well with these models - saying something like "Do not include any steps or
instructions" resulted in almost always having steps or instructions in the image.
I needed to avoid the words "steps", "instructions", etc. entirely!

  }}
/>

### Application Framework

I built the application with Next.js server components. This was my second project with the app router
and React server components (the first was this blog). This time around, I definitely understood the concepts
better, so things went a lot faster. I used some form actions and got to use the `useFormStatus` hook for the
first time.

> A side note: It's well-documented that [I don't like useEffect](https://keegan.codes/blog/reacting-to-prop-changes-in-react-functional-components).
> With server components and form actions, I didn't have to use `useEffect` anywhere in the application! That's a big win in my book

/>

### Deployment

The project is deployed on Vercel.
