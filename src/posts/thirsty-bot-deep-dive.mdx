A few days ago I [introduced Thirsty Bot](https://keegan.codes/blog/introducing-thirsty-bot), an AI-powered app
that helps you find cocktail recipes based on the ingredients you have at home. I built the app in 72 hours as part of a
litle personal "hackathon", and I learned a lot in the process. In this post, I'll share some of what I learned, and do
a deeper dive into how it all works.
