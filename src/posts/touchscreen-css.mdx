CSS hover effects are nice interactions that add some polish to a web application.
Hover actions are also frequently used to display additional information (like a tooltip)
for a piece of content - for example, an abbreviation or icon button. However, on most
touchscreen devices, the hover action is either not available
entirely, or doesn't work well. At best, this causes
your beautiful buttons and other hoverable elements to feel janky on mobile. At worst,
you app may be unuable on some devices.

Touch devices are primarily mobile devices, and building a poor mobile
experience simply isn't an option: [over half of internet traffic comes from mobile
devices](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/cell_phones/cell-phone-statistics.html#mobile-shopping).
Let's look at how to use CSS to change our app's behavior, and optimize for a great
user experience across all input methods.

## Detecting Hover State Availability

It all comes down to being able to detect whether a browser has the hover capability
or not. We can use an `@media` query to detect if hover is available:

```css
@media (hover: hover) {
  a:hover {
    background: transparent;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

The hover style will only be applied if the device's **primary input mechanism
supports hover events**. But what does that mean exactly?

According to the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/hover),
the `hover` feature query gets the value `hover` when "The primary input mechanism can conveniently
hover over elements." The word _conveniently_ is doing a lot of work here, but it's a bit
ambiguous. While the iPhone, for example, does trigger hover events after an awkward
longer-than-normal press, it's not a convenient interaction, so the `hover` feature value
is `none`. Other times the value is `none` are when
the primary input mechanism cannot hover at all, or there is no pointing mechanism (i.e. a mouse).

If you want to target this negative state, you can check the `hover` feature again, this time for the
`none` value:

```css
@media (hover: none) {
  a {
    color: black;
  }
}
```

You can also use the inverse of the `hover: hover` feature query as well:

```css
@media not (hover: hover) {
  a {
    color: black;
  }
}
```

## Applications

One application of this pattern is for showing touch users content that is normally
only available on hover - for example, a tooltip. If you have an icon button
that performs an action, you should at the very least have a tooltip that indicates
what the button does. On touch devices, this tooltip won't be useful, because it will never
show (or at least be _inconvenient_ to trigger). Here's an example of how we can solve this with CSS:

```html
<button data-tooltip-text="Go Home">
  <!-- Assume this renders a home icon -->
  <i data-icon="home" />
</button>
```

```css
/* Applies on devices with hover events */
@media (hover: hover) {
  button:hover::after {
    content: attr(data-tooltip-text);
    background-color: #363636;
    position: absolute;
    padding: 2px 6px;
    margin-left: 4px;
    color: white;
    border-radius: 8px;
  }
}

/* Applies on devices without hover events (like a phone) */
@media not (hover: hover) {
  button::after {
    content: ' Â· ' attr(data-tooltip-text);
  }
}
```

When the hover feature is available, the tooltip text is displayed on hover in a tooltip!
When the hover feature is not available, it's displayed inline in the content, eliminating
the need for a tooltip all together.

## Debugging

You don't want to have to pull out your mobile phone every time you want to test
these CSS rules and queries. Luckily, the Chrome developer tools allow you to emulate this property
super easily, just by toggling on responsive mode. Here's the desktop version
of my example:

![](css-touch-devices:icons-desktop.png)

After turning on the responsive design viewer, I get the non-hoverable state:

![](css-touch-devices:icons-mobile.png)

Pretty handy! I use this a lot to go back and forth between designing for touch
interfaces and non-touch interfaces.

## Conclusion

This is a simple pattern that's highly flexible when creating complex designs.
It's a useful tool for my button hover states, but as you can see, there are are lot more
opportunities out there to build some interesting, truly responsive interfaces that
are accessible to users of all devices.
