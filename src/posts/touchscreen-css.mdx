CSS hover effects are a nice way to add some polish to a web application.
Hover actions are also frequently used to display additional information
for a piece of content. However, the hover action is either not available
entirely, or doesn't work well on most touchscreen devices.

Touch devices are primarily mobile devices, and building a poor mobile
experience isn't an option: [over half of internet traffic comes from mobile
devices](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/cell_phones/cell-phone-statistics.html#mobile-shopping).
Let's look at how to use CSS to adjust our app's behavior.

## Detecting Hover State Availability

We can use an `@media` query to detect if hover is available:

```css
@media (hover: hover) {
  a:hover {
    background: transparent;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

The hover style will only be applied if the device's primary input mechanism
supports hover events. But what does that mean exactly?

According to the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/hover),
the `hover` feature gets the value `hover` when "The primary input mechanism can conveniently
hover over elements." The word _conveniently_ is doing a lot of work here, but it's a bit
ambiguous. While the iPhone, for example, does trigger hover events after an awkward
longer-than-normal press, it's not a convenient interaction, so the `hover` feature value
is `none`. Other times the value is `none` are when
the primary input mechanism cannot hover at all, or there is no pointing mechanism (i.e. a mouse).

If you want to target this state, you can queck the `hover` feature again:

```css
@media (hover: none) {
  a {
    background: lightgreen;
    color: black;
  }
}
```
