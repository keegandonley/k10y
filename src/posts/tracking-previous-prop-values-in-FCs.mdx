If you've been building with React for a while, you probably at one point used a lifecycle method
called `componentDidUpdate`. This method was called after a component changed, giving
you the ability to perform some series of actions based on new props, or state. If you want a refresher, you can read
more in the [legacy React docs](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidupdate), but remember, this
is not the recommended approach anymore.

Today, we have functional React components and hooks. In the React hooks world, you can't use these old lifecycle methods to react to prop changes.
This is largely a good thing,
and forces you as the developer to avoid patterns where you need to compare old and new props. If you find
yourself reaching for this as a solution, it's a good opportunity to stop and think if there's a
simpler solution that doesn't require you to compare props.

However, sometimes it's still necessary to react to prop changes in some way,
so let's get into how you can do this today with modern React.

## You Don't Need useEffect

> As a rule of thumb, useEffect should be a last-resort tool that is only leveraged when there is truly no alternative.
> It's not quite an anti-pattern, but think of useEffect as a code smell.

You might have tried to accomplish this previously using a combination of useEffect and refs to track the previous prop value.
This isn't great because you have to render with stale data, run the effect, then render again with the updated values.

There's a better way if we ditch the effect! Instead, we can
use a state variable to track the previous prop value, and simply update it conditionally while we render.
Let's jump right in and take a look at how it works:

```jsx
const ComponentWithPropChangeHandler = ({ externalData }) => {
  const [previousExternalData, setPreviousExternalData] =
    useState(externalData);

  if (!isEqual(externalData, previousExternalData)) {
    setPreviousExternalData(externalData);
    /* Here, you can react to the fact that the prop changed */
  }

  /* ...Rendering logic */
};
```

> Notice there is no effect here; all this code does is set the previous options when they change, and
> use a comparison to guard against infinite renders. Assume _isEqual_ has been implemented somewhere to
> compare the two values.

This can be taken a step further, to call a function with both the stale and updated version of the `externalData` prop:

```jsx
const ComponentWithPropChangeHandler = ({ externalData }) => {
  const [previousExternalData, setPreviousExternalData] =
    useState(externalData);

  const handleExternalDataChange = (oldProp, newProp) => {
    /* Handle prop change */
  };

  if (!isEqual(externalData, previousExternalData)) {
    handleExternalDataChange(previousExternalData, externalData);
    setPreviousExternalData(externalData);
  }

  /* ...Rendering logic */
};
```

`handleExternalDataChange` can now handle any side-effects you need to run when the prop changes.
However, **this is still a side-effect**, so you should be careful about what you do here, or better yet,
try to avoid reacting to prop changes entirely.

## One More Warning

Sometimes, it's unavoidable to do things in a less-than-ideal way. I started using this pattern working
on a legacy codebase to replace some effects. I am not willing nor do I have the time to rewrite major parts of the application to avoid the need
for this pattern entirely at this time, but it's an improvement in both maintainability and performance.

Be aware: setting state when rendering means your component's rendering is not pure, and also opens you up to
potential infinite render loops. Imagine if `isEqual` has a bug, and always returns false:

```javascript
if (!buggedIsEqual(externalData, previousExternalData) /* always true */) {
  handleExternalDataChange(previousExternalData, externalData);
  setPreviousExternalData(externalData);
}
```

> This will cause your compoenent to update its state on every render, triggering another render. React will
> eventually crash after reaching its maximum update depth.

All that to say: This is a powerful pattern that can be used to solve some problems, but it's not
without its own issues, and you probably shouldn't reach for it as a first solution.

## Conclusion

The React documentation has [a nice guide to replacing effects](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) with better approaches. It's a
valuable resource and I recommend any React developer be familiar with it.

You may be wondering if the React docs recommend the approach I covered here. In class-based components, setting state from the render function was a major faux pas!
However, for modern React, the docs do recommend it as a last resort, but
like I outlined earlier, they also recommend writing logic in a way that avoids the need to react to prop changes in this way at all.

Now, get to replacing your effects!
