I recently moved, and as a first-time homeowner one of the biggest aspects of homeownership I was looking forward
to was being able to rewire the house to support a fast and reliable network. Previously, I was using an Eero
mesh network in the house I was renting, and you can read more about that setup in [my writeup from a couple years
ago](https://keegan.codes/blog/my-home-network-configuration-for-speed-and-privacy).

I had been eyeing Ubiquiti's Unifi line of networking equipment for a while, and I finally decided to pull the
trigger after careful planning of cable runs while the house was being renovated. Here's how I came to that decision
and how I have it all set up.

## Requirements

I started off with a list of requirements for the new network, based on what I learned from my previous house's installation.

#### Ethernet backhaul for all access points

My old mesh network worked alright, but for the best performance and reliability I wanted to have all of my access
points hard wired using ethernet.

#### Wired clients wherever possible

Everything that's internet-connected and stationary should have a wired connection. This includes all smart TVs,
Apple TVs, game consoles, speakers, etc.

#### Subscription-free

My old Eero network required a subscription to get the most out of it, and I didn't want to have to pay a monthly
fee for my new setup.
