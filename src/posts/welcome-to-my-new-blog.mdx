This is an entirely new website built from the ground-up using many modern technologies and frameworks.
In this post I'm going to dive into how it's built! I wrote this blog post over the course of
a month while I was building the new application.

## Tools Used

This website is build using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), and more specifically, the new
[app directory](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) that's currently in beta. Here are some other
tools I used:

- MDX (for writing content)
- CSS Modules
- FontAwesome

## Components

I built quite a few unique components for this website! Let's take a look at some of my favorites:

### Theme Toggle

<InteractiveContent>
  <ThemeToggle relative ignoreGlobalState />
  
  Animated when switching between light and dark modes

</InteractiveContent>

### Theme

The theme is using simple CSS variables:

```css
:root {
  /* Theme colors */
  --theme-blue-1: #87ceeb;
  --theme-blue-2: #1e90ff;
  --theme-blue-3: #000080;
  --theme-text: #19376d;
  --theme-yellow: #f6ae2d;
  --theme-dark: #272727;
  --theme-inverted-text: #e3e5f0;

  /* Theme animation */
  --animation: 0.5s ease-in-out;
  --animation-curve: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.85, 0.45, 1.3);
}
```
