This is an entirely new website built from the ground-up using many of the bleeding-edge features from [NextJS](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
In this post I'm going to dive into how it's built!

## NextJS App Directory

Everything you see here is built using the (still in beta) NextJS App directory. This is a new way of routing in NextJS that
allows you to have shared layouts between routes, display multiple routes at once, and intercept route changes.

Here's a pared-down version of my app file structure. All I removed are css files and some utilities/components that are not relevant to this post:

```bash
.
├── @postModal
│   ├── (...)blog
│   │   └── [slug]
│   │       ├── loading.module.css
│   │       ├── loading.tsx
│   │       └── page.tsx
│   └── default.ts
├── [shortCode]
│   └── page.tsx
├── blog
│   ├── @modal
│   │   ├── (...)blog
│   │   │   └── [slug]
│   │   │       ├── loading.tsx
│   │   │       ├── page.tsx
│   │   └── default.ts
│   ├── [slug]
│   │   ├── not-found.tsx
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── default.ts
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   ├── tag
│   │   └── [tag]
│   │       └── page.tsx
├── home.module.css
├── layout.tsx
├── library
│   ├── @libraryModal
│   │   ├── (...)library
│   │   │   └── [slug]
│   │   │       ├── loading.tsx
│   │   │       └── page.tsx
│   │   └── default.ts
│   ├── [slug]
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── default.ts
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── util.ts
└── page.tsx
```

This pattern allows me to do some interesting things that were not previously possible. For example, when switching from the home
page to my blog page, you'll note that the navigation animates at the top of the page when transitioning. This is because the
navigation lives in `layout.tsx` at the top level of my app, and nested pages are rendered inside the layout.

The other cool thing you can do with the app directory is URL-based modals, which is how I did the effect on my blog where posts are opened
in a slide-up tray, until you perform a hard refresh, at which point they are opened full-screen as a normal page. This is done with a combination
of [parallel routes](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/parallel-routes) and [intercepted routes](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/intercepting-routes).

Folders that begin with an `@`, like `@modal`, become "slots" that can be rendered in their accompanying layout. So, my blog page layout is like this:

```tsx
export default function BlogLayout({ children, modal }: any) {
  return (
    <>
      {children}
      {modal}
    </>
  );
}
```

Everything under the `@modal` subtree can be rendered after the layout's children!

The last thing we need to do for the modal behavior is
intercept the route change and render the modal instead of the page. This is done using intercepted routes. The folders that begin with `(...)` are
intercepted routes. They can be used to render an alternate page when the route transitions to the one that is being intercepted. In this case,
clicking an article from `/blog` will transition to `/blog/[slug]`, which is intercepted by `(...)blog/[slug]` and causes the `@modal` page to be rendered alongside the children.

I can even still return a `loading.tsx` file from the parallel route, to show a loading indicator if the post page is not yet loaded:

```tsx
import { faSpinnerThird } from "@fortawesome/pro-solid-svg-icons";
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from "@fortawesome/react-fontawesome";
import styles from "./loading.module.css";

export default function BlogModalLoading() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faSpinnerThird} spin className={styles.icon} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## NextJS Image Component

Nothing kills performance of a website like large images, but you'll notice they're pervasive throughout my site and blog. This works thanks to the NextJS
Image component, which automatically optimizes images for the device size and screen resolution. It also supports lazy loading and blur-up effects, which
I leverage nearly everywhere.

My images are stored in a number of different R2 buckets on Cloudflare, and I automatically build blurred representations of each one. This blur dataUrl as
well as image metadata (like dimensions) are stored in a JSON file that is generated at build time. This allows me to use the `<Image />` component effectively,
by passing in dimensions and blur dataUrl for each image. All of the image preprocessing and metadata generation happens in Go. Here's an example of how I create
the blurDataUrl:

```go
image, _ := downloadImage(bucketURL + *fileName)
blurred, _ := stackblur.Process(image, 2000)

newImage := resize.Resize(100, 0, blurred, resize.NearestNeighbor)

// Encode the blurred image to JPEG
var buf bytes.Buffer
imgErr := jpeg.Encode(&buf, newImage, &jpeg.Options{Quality: 75})
if imgErr != nil {
  os.Exit(1)
}

// Base64-encode the image data
encoded := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(buf.Bytes())

// Create a data URL with the appropriate MIME type
dataURL := "data:image/jpeg;base64," + encoded
```

## NextJS OG Image

"OG" images, or opengraph images, are the cards you see rendered when sharing a link on social media. I wanted to have custom OG images for each of my blog posts,
but I didn't want to have to manually create them. I also wanted to be able to use the same image for the blog post header itself, and `@vercel/og` is perfect for this.

Here's the og image for this post:

<SimpleImg
  src={`/api/og/post?slug=${slug}&width=1200&height=630`}
  width={600}
  height={315}
/>

Here's a super pared down example of my OG handler (see the full handler [here](https://github.com/keegandonley/keegan.codes/blob/main/src/app/api/og/page/route.tsx) if you're curious). Using
a subset of CSS, you can build the card using react (and components work too!) and then return it as an image:

```tsx
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
  const found = getComponentForSearchParams(searchParams);

  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div
        style={{
          width: "100%",
          height: "100%",
          display: "flex",
          flexDirection: "column",
          background: `url(${found.image})`,
        }}
      >
        {found.title}
        {found.description}
      </div>
    ),
    {
      width: found.width,
      height: found.height,
    }
  );
}
```

## Vercel Edge Config

[Vercel edge config](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/edge-config) is a data store with negligible latency that can be used to store
small amounts of data. I use it to conditionally hide or show a maintenance banner on my site. With edge configs, I can
turn it on and off and change the message without having to redeploy my site.

My edge config currently looks like this:

```json
{
  "event": {
    "text": "Currently under construction, but feel free to look around!",
    "active": false
  }
}
```

Reading the config is as simple as:

```tsx
import { get } from "@vercel/edge-config";

const event = await get("event");

return (
  <html lang="en">
    <body>
      {/* Display banner text from the edge config if an event is active */}
      {event?.active ? <Banner level={1}>{event.text}</Banner> : null}
      {/* remaining content here */}
    </body>
  </html>
);
```

## MDX Rendering

I use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to render my blog posts. MDX is a superset of markdown that allows you to embed React components in your markdown, among other
advanced features. In the app directory paradigm of NextJS, MDX rendering is a bit tricker than in the
past, but it's still possible.

I have each post in a file, with the main content, and some exports at the top for the metadata:

```markdown
export const title = "Welcome to my New Blog!";
export const slug = "welcome-to-my-new-blog";
export const cover = "blog-launch-cover.png";
export const description =
"How my new website is built using the latest NextJS app directory, and other bleeding-edge features";
export const published = new Date(2023, 4, 31);

This is an entirely new website built from the ground-up using many of the bleeding-edge features from [NextJS](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
In this post I'm going to dive into how it's built!
```

The MDX file can then be imported in `blog/[slug]/page.tsx` and rendered from there!

```tsx
const found = getComponentForKey({ key: componentKey });
const Component = found.default;

if (!Component) {
  notFound();
}

const { title, cover, metadata } = found;

return (
  <>
    <div>
      <Image
        src={`${BUCKET_URL}/${cover}`}
        alt="todo"
        fill
        priority
        {...metadata}
      />
    </div>
    <article>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <Component />
    </article>
  </>
);
```

MDX is great because I can import React components and render them, yielding much more dynamic
blog posts than on my old blog. For example, I can render elements like my theme toggle:

<ThemeToggle relative ignoreGlobalState />

I plan to use this for more interactive posts in the future, but it's already being leveraged in
a few places, like that OG image preview from earlier.

## CSS Modules

More importantly, <em>why not tailwind?</em>. I'm a big proponent of Tailwind and use it heavily for projects,
especially for ones I need to stand up quickly. However, I knew that I wanted my website to have a unique, and
complex design that I felt would require an unweildy number of tailwind classes. I also wanted to be able to
keep my CSS skills sharp, and building this website was a great way to do that.

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed this dive into how my new website is built! I'm really excited about the new features and look,
and I'm, excited for what's to come. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://keegan.codes/twitter) or [Bluesky](https://keegan.codes/bsky)!
