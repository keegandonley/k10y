I often find myself blurring the lines between my hobbies and my career. I certainly consider software engineering a hobby, and many of my side projects
are engineering explorations or experiments that I later apply to my day-to-day work, and vice-versa. Recently, some work I was doing for a project
to allow promises to be serialized and sent back-and-forth between web workers became the foundation for the plugin
engine I built at [Kizen](https://kizen.com/). This "collaboration" so to speak between my hobby code and my work code
has been super valuable time and time again. With that in mind, I decided to take a look at some of my other hobbies and see
if they fit into my career in any way.

## So What Do I Like To Do?

People who know me, know that I don't half-ass anything. I like this characterization of myself, because it's completely accurate.
I tend to get sucked into hobbies that I enjoy, and I'm always on the lookout for new things to try. When something "clicks" with me,
I go all-in.

I built these visualizations for my bike rides, because I prefer to have
control over how they look, rather than embedding them from a third party.
